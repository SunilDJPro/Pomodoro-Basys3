LUTAR-1#1 Warning
LUT drives async reset alert  
LUT cell timer/minutes_reg[4]_LDC_i_1, with 2 or more inputs, drives asynchronous preset/clear pin(s) timer/minutes_reg[2]_C/CLR, timer/minutes_reg[2]_LDC/CLR,
timer/minutes_reg[3]_P/PRE, timer/minutes_reg[4]_P/PRE. The LUT may glitch and trigger an unexpected reset, even if it is a properly timed path.
Related violations: <none>

LUTAR-1#2 Warning
LUT drives async reset alert  
LUT cell timer/minutes_reg[4]_LDC_i_2, with 2 or more inputs, drives asynchronous preset/clear pin(s) timer/minutes_reg[2]_P/PRE, timer/minutes_reg[3]_C/CLR,
timer/minutes_reg[4]_C/CLR, timer/minutes_reg[4]_LDC/CLR. The LUT may glitch and trigger an unexpected reset, even if it is a properly timed path.
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#1 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An input delay is missing on BTNC relative to the rising and/or falling clock edge(s) of sys_clk_pin.

LATCH-1#1 Advisory
Existing latches in the design  
There are 2 latches found in the design. Inferred latches are often the result of HDL coding mistakes, such as incomplete if or case statements.
Related violations: <none>
